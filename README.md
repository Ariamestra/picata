## PICA TA: Peer Instruction and Continuous Assessment via a (digital) TA

### Overview
PICA TA is a tool for instructors whose primary function is to use the results of a recent continuous assessment (CA), e.g. a Canvas Quiz, to provide students with subsequent small-group peer instruction (PI) sessions. This initial version of PICA TA is console/terminal based and is specific to the Canvas LMS platform. The instructor/user is presented with a series of menus to initiate a select a Canvas Course, a Quiz, and then to initiate the PI session based on these selections. The software is under development with plans for additional functionality in the future, so please feel free to make feature requests and provide any feedback (browse open GitHub Issues, and open a new Issue if you do not see the features/functionality you desire). More details on how to install and use PICA TA are given below.

### Usage

__Initiating a post-quiz PI/CL sessions__ 

Currently PICA TA does not generate the details/guidelines for the PI/CL session. Rather, the current functionality focuses on initiating the PI session, which involves: 
1. selecting a quiz and quiz question,
2. selecting and confirming pairs/groups of students for the PI/CL session, and
3. notifying students via a Canvas message of who they will work with. 

Thus, in this initial version it is the responsibility of the instructor to present students with all of the requisite material for the follow-up PI session.
