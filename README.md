## PICA TA: Peer Instruction and Continuous Assessment via a (digital) TA

### Overview
PICA TA is a tool for instructors whose primary function is to use the results of a recent continuous assessment (CA), e.g. a Canvas Quiz, to provide students with subsequent small-group peer instruction (PI) and/or collaborative learning (CL) sessions. All of the functionality provided by this initial version of PICA TA is accessed by simply running the program locally in a console/terminal. The user is presented with a series of menus to initiate a select a Canvas Course, a Quiz, and then to initiate the Peer Instruction session based on these selections. The software is under development with plans for additional functionality in the future, so please feel free to suggest features you would like see in the future (browse open GitHub Issues here, and open a new Issue if you do not see the features/functionality you desire). More details on how to install and use PICA TA are given below.

### Usage

__Initiating a post-quiz PI/CL sessions__ 

Currently PICA TA does not generate the details/guidelines for the PI/CL session. Rather, the functionality provided focuses on initiating the session, which involves: a) selecting a quiz and quiz question, b) selecting and confirming pairs/groups of students for the PI/CL session, and c) notifying students via a Canvas message of who they will work with. The intention (for now) is that the instructor will present students with all of the requisite material for the follow-up PI session. See below for more details on what it looks like to carry out these individual steps.
